### Chapter 14 [Databases], Project 2 [Travel]

Demonstrate your ability to retrieve information from a database and display it.
This will require a variety of more sophisticated SQL queries. The results when
finished will look similar to that shown in Figure 14.36.

Note: To configure database connection, edit includes/travel-config.inc.php

For some environments, you may need to initialize your MySQL once before creating and populating the data. In
Cloud9, you do so via the command:
```
mysql-ctl start
```

You will need to create and populate the database before running this code. To do so, you will need to 
use either the command line or the MySQLAdmin tool. 

For instance, in Cloud9, here are the appropriate commands:

```
mysql-ctl cli
source travel-small.sql
```
